I'm Ahmed Tremo, an Applied Scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). I previously I worked as machine learning engineer working at [Dell Techonolgies](https://www.dell.com/) & a data engineer at [Lumin Systems](http://excelsystems-eg.com/).

I graduated from The [German university in Cairo](https://www.guc.edu.eg/), with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering with an Excellent with honors grade.

I've published a [whitepaper](https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/t/demand-forecasting-a-machine-learning-based-solution-to-forecast-demand-signals-for-dell-services/) describing the features, challenges, and benefits of the demand forecasting machine 
learning-based solution I worked on at [Dell Technologies](https://www.dell.com/). I've also won the 1st place in [Dell Technologies Annual AI Hackathon](https://hacktrick.io/)

In my free time, I play football & go to the gym. Fun fact, My [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/AhmedTremo/FootballTactics) was about identifying football tactics using machine learning.

Summer 2019, I spent 3 months in the US as a part of culture exchange program called [Work and Travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_and_Travel_USA) where I worked at [Six Flags](https://www.sixflags.com/greatescape) as a ride operator. (was really fun)!
